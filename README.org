* my linux rice
after many frustrations after nuking my linux workstation again and again, i have decided to move my dotfiles here in an attempt to preserve them, and keep a log of my previous styles. RIP to my old i3 config, and the japanese theme i had and lost too :(
*** why should you use it?

* dependencies
foot
waybar
sway
swaylock
fuzzel
iosevka font

* zsh theme: common
